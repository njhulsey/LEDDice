# LEDDice
During my senior year of highschool I designed a circuit board for a teacher to use in his engineering class. This was meant to help teach
kids about soldering and electronics. On the board there is a button, Attiny45, and 7 LEDS. When the button is pressed, the leds will roll and simulate a dice. 

WHAT I LEARNED:
- ATTINY 45 programming
- Circuit Design
- Soldering
